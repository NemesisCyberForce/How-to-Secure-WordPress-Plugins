# How to secure WordPress Plugins (like a pro)

This repository demonstrates two implementations of a simple WordPress plugin that retrieves user data based on a URL parameter. Considering that WordPress powers most websites globally, this project is essential for highlighting and addressing the critical security gaps often found in such systems.
- **vulnerable:** Directly uses `$_GET` input in SQL queries without proper sanitization ‚Äì leaving the door wide open for SQL injection attacks.
- **secure:** Implements a PDO-based approach with genuine prepared statements to securely handle public input.

## Overview

In today's digital landscape‚Äîwith WordPress powering millions of websites and its user base growing year after year‚Äîit is more important than ever for developers to secure their plugins. This repository demonstrates two implementations of a simple WordPress plugin that retrieves user data based on URL parameters:

- **vulnerable:** Uses unsanitized public input directly in SQL queries, leaving your site wide open to SQL Injection attacks.
- **secure:** Implements a PDO-based approach with genuine prepared statements that securely handle user input.

By contrasting these two approaches, we emphasize that secure coding is essential when processing public input. An insecure plugin can turn your website into an open invitation for hackers, while a well-secured plugin helps maintain the integrity and safety of your site and its users.

**Key Advantages of the Secure Approach:**

- **True Prepared Statements:** Parameters are bound safely, keeping user input separate from the SQL command.
- **Enhanced Security:** Prevents SQL Injection vulnerabilities even if the input isn‚Äôt additionally sanitized.
- **Database Flexibility:** Easier migration between different database systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).

## Important Note on WordPress Database Handling

The native WordPress `$wpdb->prepare()` method is not a true prepared statement implementation like those provided by PDO. It uses a sprintf-like substitution mechanism to escape inputs, which does not fully separate the query structure from user data. In contrast, our secure approach leverages genuine PDO prepared statements, ensuring that parameters are bound securely at the database level. This offers a higher level of protection against SQL injection attacks.

## Differences

| Insecure (`vulnerable`)                     | Secure (`secure`)                              |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Direct use of `$_GET` in SQL                | Uses PDO prepared statements                   |
| Vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks         | Protects against SQL Injection                 |
| Meant for demo purposes only üî•              | Production-safe approach ‚úÖ                    |

## Installation & Testing

> [!WARNING]
>  The **vulnerable** version is intentionally insecure. **DO NOT INSTALL ON PUBLIC SERVERS!**

### Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. In your **local** WordPress installation, place both plugin folders (`vulnerable` and `secure`) into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate both plugins from the WordPress admin.

### Shortcode Usage

- Insert the shortcode `[get_user]` into a page/post to test the vulnerable version.
- Insert the shortcode `[get_user_secure]` into a separate page/post for the secure version.

### Test Scenarios

#### SQL Injection Test

1. **Vulnerable Plugin:**
   - Navigate to your page with the `[get_user]` shortcode.
   - Append the URL parameter with an injection payload, for example:  
     `?user_id=1 OR 1=1 --`
   - **Expected Result:** The insecure plugin will likely return data for all users (SQL Injection successful).

2. **Secure Plugin:**
   - Navigate to your page with the `[get_user_secure]` shortcode.
   - Append the URL parameter with the same payload:  
     `?user_id=1 OR 1=1 --`
   - **Expected Result:** The secure plugin will treat the entire input as a parameter (likely as a non-numeric string) and return ‚ÄúNo user found.‚Äù

## Why Security Matters

> **‚ÄúAn insecure plugin is like an open window in winter ‚Äì anyone can get in, and you‚Äôll be left shivering!‚Äù**

If your plugin processes public input without proper safeguards, you‚Äôre essentially inviting hackers inside. By using true prepared statements (e.g., with PDO), you help ensure that even if user input is malicious, it cannot alter the SQL commands executed by your database. With WordPress growing year after year and its vast audience, securing plugins is more critical than ever.

## Final Note

This demo is designed to drive home the importance of secure coding practices in WordPress plugin development. Developers: **Make your plugins safe if they handle public input!** Don't let your code be an open invitation for hackers.
